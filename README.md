Okay for those wanting to know how to do this without supporting Tattoo Smart, theres some gate kept knowledge within the tattoo industry, that is commonly known in the 3d industry.
Procreate supports OBJ format 3d models, you can find these buy searching "free OBJ models" but you want to make sure they include UV textures. UV textures are the 3d model flattened out, much like when you wrap an arm in gladwrap to map out a sleeve then cut it off, the flattened gladwrap? UV textures.
This file is 2USD and will import directly into procreate to draw on:

I have purchased it and added it to my google drive for anyone, go nuts:

to get it onto your ipad:
click the link, once you can see the two files, click the 3 dots and click "open in"
once the window pops up you want to "save to files"
click "on my ipad" on the left, to save them to your device (remember where)

then to go from your files on your ipad into procreate:
within procreate from the gallery click 'import' and find the Human.OBJ file that youve downloaded from the above link and thats it!


tips:
the UV maps resolution is directly related to the resolution and quality of drawing on the model, while this free model will help you plan things out, its not the resolution that the video here is showing, but it will definitely get you started to see if this is something you want to do!

in order to flatten the 3d into 2d (the UV textures) there is now a new menu item that is a toggle to 2d button. The problem with this is that UV textures are usually with a transparent background, procreate doesnt support this yet.
Workaround is to colour various parts youre interested in: bicep - green, forearm - pink etc
then when you view the 2d toggle, you will see the areas you coloured and youll know how to draw flat on it!


Tell other artists you work with, pass the knowledge around, this should just be another easy tool in our wheelhouse
